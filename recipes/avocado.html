    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Caprese stuffed avocados are a fresh and delightful twist on the traditional Caprese salad, combining the creamy richness of ripe avocados with the classic flavors of Italy. To prepare this dish, avocados are halved and pitted, then filled with a mixture of juicy cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella balls, and fragrant basil leaves. The filling is typically drizzled with a balsamic glaze or a splash of olive oil, adding a tangy sweetness that complements the creamy avocado and the savory, milky mozzarella. This dish is not only visually appealing, with its vibrant green, red, and white color palette, but also offers a satisfying balance of textures and flavors. Caprese stuffed avocados make for a perfect light meal or an impressive appetizer, celebrating the simplicity and freshness of Mediterranean cuisine.</p>
