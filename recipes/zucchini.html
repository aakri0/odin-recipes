    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mediterranean stuffed zucchini is a flavorful and healthy dish that captures the essence of the Mediterranean diet. This dish involves hollowing out zucchini and filling them with a vibrant mixture of ingredients like quinoa, couscous, or rice, combined with vegetables such as tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions. The filling is often seasoned with garlic, herbs like oregano and thyme, and sometimes spiced with a hint of cumin or paprika. Feta cheese or a sprinkle of Parmesan may be added for a touch of creaminess and saltiness. After being filled, the zucchini boats are baked until tender, allowing the flavors to meld together. The result is a light yet satisfying dish that's both visually appealing and packed with nutrients, making it a perfect choice for a wholesome meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 sweet onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>coarse salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup pine nuts</li>
        <li>¼ cup mint leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup mint leaves</li>
        <li>¾ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 2: Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking dish. Pour water into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. Continue baking until the top is crusty and browned, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
